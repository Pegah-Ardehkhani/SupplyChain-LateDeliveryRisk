## About

This project analyzes and predicts late deliveries in a supply chain dataset using **machine learning models**. The goal is to identify the risk of late delivery for orders based on features like customer, product, shipping, and sales data.

Key components of the project:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset, feature distributions, and relationships.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and extract features from dates.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented multiple classifiers including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict `Late_delivery_risk`.
* **Evaluation:** Used metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC for performance comparison.
* **Feature Importance & Explainability:** Analyzed feature contributions using Random Forest importance, LIME, SHAP, and counterfactual explanations with DiCE.

This project provides a complete pipeline for **risk prediction in supply chain management**, helping stakeholders identify potential late deliveries and optimize operations.
